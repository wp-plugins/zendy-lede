Zendy Lede allows you to add an opening statement with fullscreen video background on your Wordpress website homepage.

== Description ==

Make a splash with a fullscreen video background on your website! Zendy Lede allows you to add an opening statement with fullscreen video background on your Wordpress website homepage.

1. Upload the `zendy-lede` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I convert my video to MP4, OGV, and WebM? =

We use Miro Video Converter - a free software for Mac. We don't work on PC but a search for 'video converter for pc' should turn up plenty of options, many of them free.

= What does Zendy Lede do? =

Zendy Lede lets you configure a homepage "intro" with the following elements: a fullscreen video background, a heading, a subheading, a call-to-action link which goes to your sales page or any page on your site, and a more-info link that auto-scrolls down to your main website content.

= Does Zendy Lede use Flash? =

No. At this point, Zendy Lede is 100% HTML5. We plan on adding Flash fallback support in the future.
